Simple Trainer is no longer being updated for the time being. The latest update(s) broke several hacks in the trainer and it feels incomplete releasing anything half-broken. As the creator, I'm also taking an extended break from all things MapleStory. You can access this build by entering "admin" followed by the build # in the password box (e.g. "admin91" without quotations).

You can use GKTrainer as an alternative when it updates.

Thank you all for your support so far. This trainer has come a long way from where it began and I do hope to continue it once again at a later time.
